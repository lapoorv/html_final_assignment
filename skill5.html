    <h1>Leadership</h1>
    <p>Although on 68.6% of employers are looking for graduates with quality leadership skills, most employers think only 33% of employees demonstrate leadership qualities. By combining critical thinking, teamwork, professionalism and work ethic, and communication skills, you can become a great leader in your workplace.

        First, you have to find your leadership style. Once you identify your strengths and what your standards of excellence are, you can begin to develop your leadership style around those qualities. Once you have honed in on your leadership style, you have to begin creating a culture of self-reinforcing behavior and practices. When people see that you are enthusiastic and passionate about the work you are doing, they too get excited about their work. By creating this upbeat culture, productivity and workflow will increase. Alternatively, seeing lack of enthusiasm and passion will have the opposite impact on the workplace culture.</p>
